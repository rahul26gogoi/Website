<h1>The Best Animes According to Rahul</h1>
<h2>My top 3 animes I watched recently</h2>

<hr />

<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>I am currently watching One-Piece. I am on 940th episode. I think this anime got the most amazing story line ever. Still many episodes to for see Gear 5. You can definitely consider this to watch and its worth the number of episodes</p>

<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
<p>It is also one of the top class anime of all time. The fighting scenes are on the next level and also the animation. Gojo being the badass overpowered character and Yuji Itadori's black flash. Uffff.</p>

<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
<p>The story line is on the par with Jujutsu Kaisen. The animation is excellent and also the story of the arc. I like the character Zenitsu due to his breathing style called "Kaminari No Kokyu or Thunder Breathing".<p>
